# Lab 2 — Renaming Windows Server 2022 and Installing Active Directory

## Overview
In this lab, we will rename our Windows Server 2022 machine and install **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.  
This prepares the server to function as a domain controller in our home lab environment.

## Step 1 — Rename the Server

Now that we have Windows Server 2022 set up, we can proceed with installing Active Directory on our virtual machine home lab. 
Before that, let's rename our computer to keep things simple. To do so, open File Explorer from the taskbar, right-click on "This PC," and select "Properties."

We will rename the computer to "Server2022" and then click "OK."
A prompt will appear asking you to restart your virtual machine, which is normal. Click "OK," then select "Restart Now" to apply the changes.
