Lab 3 — Creating Help Desk Accounts in Active Directory & Using CMD Commands
Overview

In this lab, I demonstrate how to create a dedicated Help Desk account in Active Directory (AD) and manage it using CMD commands inside a Windows Server 2022 environment. This simulates real-world IT administrative tasks, such as provisioning accounts, granting permissions, and verifying user configurations through command-line tools.

This lab is part of my IT Helpdesk home lab series using VirtualBox and Windows Server 2022.
