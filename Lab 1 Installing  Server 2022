In this lab, you will install Windows Server 2022 inside a VirtualBox virtual machine.  
This server will later be used for Active Directory, Group Policy, and domain management.

We’ll download Windows Server 2022 from the official Microsoft Evaluation Center at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022.
